# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
--
The systematic way in which software is developed.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
--
Traditionally programming was code-centered as opposed to software engineering which looks at code as just a single cog in a huge wheel.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
--
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It involves identifying stakeholders' needs and ensuring that the system developed meets those needs.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
--
Modularity is the breaking down of software into smaller modular parts. Modular parts are easier to maintain, debug & fix, and even change if it doesnt meet requirements.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
--
Unit testing - Testing individual components
Integration testing - Testing interfaces between two applications
system testing - Testing the whole application
acceptance testing - Also called UATs, are done by end users to make sure functionality fails when you need to fail and pass when required

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
--
These are tools that track changes to software,e.g Git which allows having different branches apart from main/master that allow comparison and merging

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
--
A project manager looks at all the moving parts of a software, and makes sure all parts come together at the end. Can also be a scrum master in agile development methodologies to organize and oversee daily/periodic sprints

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
--
Maintenance are process for updating and resolving bugs associated therein after deployment. Can also include adding modules needed and making sure they co-work seamlessly

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
--
Plagiarism is the biggest enemy of any software engineer. 

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
